# CICD Devops Pipeline for Boardgame

This project showcases the implementation of a complete CI/CD (Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment) pipeline for a Java-based board game application. The goal is to automate the entire software delivery process — from building and testing the code to security scanning, packaging, deployment on Kubernetes, and real-time monitoring.

By integrating various DevOps tools and practices, this project ensures faster, more reliable deployments, improved code quality, and continuous visibility into application health. It serves as a practical example of how automation can streamline software development and operations in a modern development workflow.
Here are the Phases involved & architecture of the pipeline:

## Phase1_Create Vms
### Step 1: Sign in and Navigate to EC2
- Go to https://aws.amazon.com/console/ and sign in with your AWS account.
- In the AWS Management Console, search for "EC2" in the top bar and open the EC2 Dashboard.

### Step 2: Launch and Configure the Instance
- Click "Launch Instance", then:
- Select an Ubuntu AMI (e.g., Ubuntu Server 20.04 LTS).
- Choose an instance type (e.g., t2.micro for free-tier/testing).
- Proceed through the configuration options (network, storage, tags).
- You can keep the default settings unless specific changes are required.

### Step 3: Set Up Security Group and Launch
- Configure the Security Group:
- Add rules to allow access (e.g., SSH for port 22).
- Review all settings and click "Launch".
- Select an existing key pair or create a new one to access the instance.
- Click "Launch Instances" to complete the process.

### Step 4: Configure Security Group:
- In the "Step 6: Configure Security Group" section, configure the security group to allow SSH access (port 22) from your IP address.
- You may also want to allow other ports based on your requirements (e.g., HTTP, HTTPS) as in this pic Alt text

- Click "Review and Launch".

### Step 5: Review, Launch, and Access the Instance
- Review all the instance configuration settings and click "Launch".
- In the key pair dialog, choose an existing key pair or create a new one. Check the acknowledgment box and confirm the launch.
- Once the instance is running, use Mobaxterm to connect via SSH using your key pair and the public IP address of the instance.

### Step 6: Setup k8-cluster using Kubeadm
### Execute on Both "Master" & "Worker" Nodes
- Disable Swap: Required for Kubernetes to function correctly.
``` bash
sudo swapoff -a
```
- Load Necessary Kernel Modules: Required for Kubernetes networking.
```bash
cat <<EOF | sudo tee /etc/modules-load.d/k8s.conf
overlay
br_netfilter
EOF

sudo modprobe overlay
sudo modprobe br_netfilter
```
- Set Sysctl Parameters: Helps with networking.
``` bash
cat <<EOF | sudo tee /etc/sysctl.d/k8s.conf
net.bridge.bridge-nf-call-iptables  = 1
net.bridge.bridge-nf-call-ip6tables = 1
net.ipv4.ip_forward                 = 1
EOF

sudo sysctl --system
lsmod | grep br_netfilter
lsmod | grep overlay
```
- Install Containerd:
``` bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y ca-certificates curl
sudo install -m 0755 -d /etc/apt/keyrings
sudo curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg -o /etc/apt/keyrings/docker.asc
sudo chmod a+r /etc/apt/keyrings/docker.asc

echo "deb [arch=$(dpkg --print-architecture) signed-by=/etc/apt/keyrings/docker.asc] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu $(. /etc/os-release && echo \"$VERSION_CODENAME\") stable" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/docker.list > /dev/null

sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y containerd.io

containerd config default | sed -e 's/SystemdCgroup = false/SystemdCgroup = true/' -e 's/sandbox_image = "registry.k8s.io\/pause:3.6"/sandbox_image = "registry.k8s.io\/pause:3.9"/' | sudo tee /etc/containerd/config.toml

sudo systemctl restart containerd
sudo systemctl status containerd
```
- Install Kubernetes Components:
``` bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y apt-transport-https ca-certificates curl gpg

curl -fsSL https://pkgs.k8s.io/core:/stable:/v1.29/deb/Release.key | sudo gpg --dearmor -o /etc/apt/keyrings/kubernetes-apt-keyring.gpg

echo 'deb [signed-by=/etc/apt/keyrings/kubernetes-apt-keyring.gpg] https://pkgs.k8s.io/core:/stable:/v1.29/deb/ /' | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/kubernetes.list

sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y kubelet kubeadm kubectl
sudo apt-mark hold kubelet kubeadm kubectl
```

### Execute ONLY on the "Master" Node
- Initialize the Cluster:
``` bash
sudo kubeadm init
```
- Set Up Local kubeconfig:
``` bash
mkdir -p "$HOME"/.kube
sudo cp -i /etc/kubernetes/admin.conf "$HOME"/.kube/config
sudo chown "$(id -u)":"$(id -g)" "$HOME"/.kube/config
```
- Install a Network Plugin (Calico):
```bash
kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/projectcalico/calico/v3.26.0/manifests/calico.yaml
```
Generate Join Command:
```bash
kubeadm token create --print-join-command
```
Copy this generated token for next command.

### Execute on ALL of your Worker Nodes
- Perform pre-flight checks:
``` bash
sudo kubeadm reset pre-flight checks
```
- Paste the join command you got from the master node and append --v=5 at the end:
``` bash
sudo kubeadm join <private-ip-of-control-plane>:6443 --token <token> --discovery-token-ca-cert-hash sha256:<hash> --cri-socket 
"unix:///run/containerd/containerd.sock" --v=5
```
Note: When pasting the join command from the master node:

Add sudo at the beginning of the command
Add --v=5 at the end,
Example format:
``` bash
sudo <paste-join-command-here> --v=5
```
### Step 7: Installing Jenkins on Ubuntu
``` bash
#!/bin/bash

# Install OpenJDK 17 JRE Headless
sudo apt install openjdk-17-jre-headless -y

# Download Jenkins GPG key
sudo wget -O /usr/share/keyrings/jenkins-keyring.asc \
  https://pkg.jenkins.io/debian-stable/jenkins.io-2023.key

# Add Jenkins repository to package manager sources
echo deb [signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/jenkins-keyring.asc] \
  https://pkg.jenkins.io/debian-stable binary/ | sudo tee \
  /etc/apt/sources.list.d/jenkins.list > /dev/null

# Update package manager repositories
sudo apt-get update

# Install Jenkins
sudo apt-get install jenkins -y
```
Save this script in a file, for example, install_jenkins.sh, and make it executable using:
``` bash
chmod +x install_jenkins.sh
```
Then, you can run the script using:
``` bash
./install_jenkins.sh
```
This script will automate the installation process of OpenJDK 17 JRE Headless and Jenkins.

- Install docker for future use
``` bash
#!/bin/bash

# Update package manager repositories
sudo apt-get update

# Install necessary dependencies
sudo apt-get install -y ca-certificates curl

# Create directory for Docker GPG key
sudo install -m 0755 -d /etc/apt/keyrings

# Download Docker's GPG key
sudo curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg -o /etc/apt/keyrings/docker.asc

# Ensure proper permissions for the key
sudo chmod a+r /etc/apt/keyrings/docker.asc

# Add Docker repository to Apt sources
echo "deb [arch=$(dpkg --print-architecture) signed-by=/etc/apt/keyrings/docker.asc] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu \
$(. /etc/os-release && echo "$VERSION_CODENAME") stable" | \
sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/docker.list > /dev/null

# Update package manager repositories
sudo apt-get update

sudo apt-get install -y docker-ce docker-ce-cli containerd.io docker-buildx-plugin docker-compose-plugin 
```
Save this script in a file, for example, install_docker.sh, and make it executable using:
``` bash
chmod +x install_docker.sh
```
Then, you can run the script using:
``` bash
./install_docker.sh
```
### Step 8: Setup Nexus
``` bash
#!/bin/bash

# Update package manager repositories
sudo apt-get update

# Install necessary dependencies
sudo apt-get install -y ca-certificates curl

# Create directory for Docker GPG key
sudo install -m 0755 -d /etc/apt/keyrings

# Download Docker's GPG key
sudo curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg -o /etc/apt/keyrings/docker.asc

# Ensure proper permissions for the key
sudo chmod a+r /etc/apt/keyrings/docker.asc

# Add Docker repository to Apt sources
echo "deb [arch=$(dpkg --print-architecture) signed-by=/etc/apt/keyrings/docker.asc] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu \
$(. /etc/os-release && echo "$VERSION_CODENAME") stable" | \
sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/docker.list > /dev/null

# Update package manager repositories
sudo apt-get update

sudo apt-get install -y docker-ce docker-ce-cli containerd.io docker-buildx-plugin docker-compose-plugin 
```
Save this script in a file, for example, install_docker.sh, and make it executable using:
``` bash
chmod +x install_docker.sh
```
Then, you can run the script using:
``` bash
./install_docker.sh
```
### Create Nexus using docker container
To create a Docker container running Nexus 3 and exposing it on port 8081, you can use the following command:
``` bash
docker run -d --name nexus -p 8081:8081 sonatype/nexus3:latest
```
This command does the following:
- -d: Detaches the container and runs it in the background.
- --name nexus: Specifies the name of the container as "nexus".
- -p 8081:8081: Maps port 8081 on the host to port 8081 on the container, allowing access to Nexus through port 8081.
- sonatype/nexus3:latest: Specifies the Docker image to use for the container, in this case, the latest version of Nexus 3 from the Sonatype repository.
After running this command, Nexus will be accessible on your host machine at http://IP:8081.
### Get Nexus initial password
Your provided commands are correct for accessing the Nexus password stored in the container. Here's a breakdown of the steps:
- Get Container ID: You need to find out the ID of the Nexus container. You can do this by running:
``` bash
docker ps
```
This command lists all running containers along with their IDs, among other information.
- Access Container's Bash Shell: Once you have the container ID, you can execute the docker exec command to access the container's bash shell:
``` bash
docker exec -it <container_ID> /bin/bash
```
Replace <container_ID> with the actual ID of the Nexus container.
- Navigate to Nexus Directory: Inside the container's bash shell, navigate to the directory where Nexus stores its configuration:
``` bash
cd sonatype-work/nexus3
```
- View Admin Password: Finally, you can view the admin password by displaying the contents of the admin.password file:
``` bash
cat admin.password
```
- Exit the Container Shell: Once you have retrieved the password, you can exit the container's bash shell:
``` bash
exit
```
This process allows you to access the Nexus admin password stored within the container. Make sure to keep this password secure, as it grants administrative access to your Nexus instance.

### Step 9: SetUp SonarQube
``` bash
#!/bin/bash

# Update package manager repositories
sudo apt-get update

# Install necessary dependencies
sudo apt-get install -y ca-certificates curl

# Create directory for Docker GPG key
sudo install -m 0755 -d /etc/apt/keyrings

# Download Docker's GPG key
sudo curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg -o /etc/apt/keyrings/docker.asc

# Ensure proper permissions for the key
sudo chmod a+r /etc/apt/keyrings/docker.asc

# Add Docker repository to Apt sources
echo "deb [arch=$(dpkg --print-architecture) signed-by=/etc/apt/keyrings/docker.asc] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu \
$(. /etc/os-release && echo "$VERSION_CODENAME") stable" | \
sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/docker.list > /dev/null

# Update package manager repositories
sudo apt-get update

sudo apt-get install -y docker-ce docker-ce-cli containerd.io docker-buildx-plugin docker-compose-plugin 
```
Save this script in a file, for example, install_docker.sh, and make it executable using:
``` bash
chmod +x install_docker.sh
```
Then, you can run the script using:
``` bash
./install_docker.sh
```
### Create Sonarqube Docker container
To run SonarQube in a Docker container with the provided command, you can follow these steps:
  1. Open your terminal or command prompt.
  2. Run the following command:
``` bash
docker run -d --name sonar -p 9000:9000 sonarqube:latest
```
This command will download the sonarqube:latest Docker image from Docker Hub if it's not already available locally. Then, it will create a container named "sonar" from this image, running it in detached mode (-d flag) and mapping port 9000 on the host machine to port 9000 in the container (-p 9000:9000 flag).

3. Access SonarQube by opening a web browser and navigating to http://<public-ip>:9000.

This will start the SonarQube server, and you should be able to access it using the provided URL. If you're running Docker on a remote server or a different port, replace localhost with the appropriate hostname or IP address and adjust the port accordingly.




## Phase2_Git-Repo-Setup
### Steps to create a private Git repository, generate a personal access token, connect to the repository, and push code to it:
### 1. Create a Private Git Repository:
- Go to your preferred Git hosting platform (e.g., GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket).
- Log in to your account or sign up if you don't have one.
- Create a new repository and set it as private.
### 2. Generate a Personal Access Token:
- Navigate to your account settings or profile settings.
- Look for the "Developer settings" or "Personal access tokens" section.
- Generate a new token, providing it with the necessary permissions (e.g., repo access).
### 3. Clone the Repository Locally:
- Open Git Bash or your terminal.
- Navigate to the directory where you want to clone the repository.
- Use the git clone command followed by the repository's URL. For example:
``` bash
git clone <repository_URL>
```
Replace <repository_URL> with the URL of your private repository.
### 4. Add Your Source Code Files:
- Navigate into the cloned repository directory.
- Paste your source code files or create new ones inside this directory.
### 5. Stage and Commit Changes:
- Use the git add command to stage the changes:
``` bash
git add .
``` 
- Use the git commit command to commit the staged changes along with a meaningful message:
``` bash
git commit -m "Your commit message here"
```
### 6. Push Changes to the Repository:
- Use the git push command to push your committed changes to the remote repository:
``` bash
git push
```
- If it's your first time pushing to this repository, you might need to specify the remote and branch:
``` bash
git push -u origin master
```
Replace master with the branch name if you're pushing to a different branch.
### 7. Enter Personal Access Token as Authentication:
- When prompted for credentials during the push, enter your username (usually your email) and use your personal access token as the password.

By following these steps, you'll be able to create a private Git repository, connect to it using Git Bash, and push your code changes securely using a personal access token for authentication.
## Phase3_CICD
### Install Plugins in Jenkins
### 1. Eclipse Temurin Installer:
- This plugin enables Jenkins to automatically install and configure the Eclipse Temurin JDK (formerly known as AdoptOpenJDK).
- To install, go to Jenkins dashboard -> Manage Jenkins -> Manage Plugins -> Available tab.

- Click on the "Install without restart" button.
### 2. Pipeline Maven Integration:
- This plugin provides Maven support for Jenkins Pipeline.
- It allows you to use Maven commands directly within your Jenkins Pipeline scripts.
- To install, follow the same steps as above, but search for "Pipeline Maven Integration" instead.
### 3. Config File Provider:
- This plugin allows you to define configuration files (e.g., properties, XML, JSON) centrally in Jenkins.
- These configurations can then be referenced and used by your Jenkins jobs.
- Install it using the same procedure as mentioned earlier.
### 4. SonarQube Scanner:
- SonarQube is a code quality and security analysis tool.
- This plugin integrates Jenkins with SonarQube by providing a scanner that analyzes code during builds.
- You can install it from the Jenkins plugin manager as described above.
### 5. Kubernetes CLI:
- This plugin allows Jenkins to interact with Kubernetes clusters using the Kubernetes command-line tool (kubectl).
- It's useful for tasks like deploying applications to Kubernetes from Jenkins jobs.
- Install it through the plugin manager.
### 6. Kubernetes:
- This plugin integrates Jenkins with Kubernetes by allowing Jenkins agents to run as pods within a Kubernetes cluster.
- It provides dynamic scaling and resource optimization capabilities for Jenkins builds.
- Install it from the Jenkins plugin manager.
### 7. Docker:
- This plugin allows Jenkins to interact with Docker, enabling Docker builds and integration with Docker registries.
- You can use it to build Docker images, run Docker containers, and push/pull images from Docker registries.
- Install it from the plugin manager.
### 8. Docker Pipeline Step:
- This plugin extends Jenkins Pipeline with steps to build, publish, and run Docker containers as part of your Pipeline scripts.
- It provides a convenient way to manage Docker containers directly from Jenkins Pipelines.
- Install it through the plugin manager like the others.
After installing these plugins, you may need to configure them according to your specific environment and requirements. This typically involves setting up credentials, configuring paths, and specifying options in Jenkins global configuration or individual job configurations. Each plugin usually comes with its own set of documentation to guide you through the configuration process.

```
### 4. Configure Prometheus
- Navigate to your Prometheus folder:
``` bash
cd <prometheus-folder>
```
- Edit the prometheus.yml file and add the following configuration
``` bash
scrape_configs:
  - job_name: 'blackbox'
    metrics_path: /probe
    params:
      module: [http_2xx]  # Look for a HTTP 200 response.
    static_configs:
      - targets:
        - http://prometheus.io    # Target to probe with http.
        - http://example.com:8080 # Target to probe with http on port 8080.
    relabel_configs:
      - source_labels: [__address__]
        target_label: __param_target
      - source_labels: [__param_target]
        target_label: instance
      - target_label: __address__
        replacement: public-ip:9115  # The blackbox exporter's real hostname:port.
  - job_name: 'blackbox_exporter'  # collect blackbox exporter's operational metrics.
    static_configs:
      - targets: ['public-ip:9115']
```
Replace <public-ip> and <jenkins-ip> with your actual IP addresses.
- Restart prometheus
``` bash
pgrep prometheus
kill <id>
./prometheus &
```
- Open Grafana → Add Prometheus as a data source → Import dashboards for Blackbox and Node Exporter.
- Install Prometheus Metrics Plugin inside Jenkins and configure it to expose metrics at /prometheus.

### 5. Install node exporter on jenkins for system level Monitoring
- Run the following command on your Jenkins instance to start Node Exporter
``` bash
docker run -d \
  --net="host" \
  --pid="host" \
  -v "/:/host:ro,rslave" \
  quay.io/prometheus/node-exporter:latest \
  --path.rootfs=/host
  ```
- Access the Node Exporter web interface at
``` bash
http://<public-ip-jenkins>:9100
```
- Edit the prometheus.yml file in your Prometheus folder to include the following scrape jobs
``` bash
scrape_configs:
  - job_name: 'node_exporter'
    static_configs:
      - targets: ['jenkins-ip:9100']

  - job_name: 'jenkins'
    metrics_path: '/prometheus'
    static_configs:
      - targets: ['jenkins-ip:8080']
```
 Replace <jenkins-ip> with your actual Jenkins instance IP.
- Restart prometheus
``` bash
pgrep prometheus
kill <id>
./prometheus & 
```
- In Grafana:
Add a new dashboard ->
Choose Prometheus as the data source -> Import or create panels for system-level metrics (e.g., CPU, memory, disk, etc.) using Node Exporter data.

✅ Now you can visualize and monitor system metrics of your Jenkins instance using Grafana dashboards.
